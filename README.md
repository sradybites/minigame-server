# Backend layer for a small web game

This project is being completed for my final project in the Intro to Backend Development course at Cornell. After finishing, I intend to create a web game that operates on top of this project. For now, it will solely contain the backend for such a game, including object-relational mapping and data access tools and routes, with filler code where game-specific logic would be implemented.

## Deployment

This system will be containerized with Docker to be deployed on a server running Ubuntu. I intend to host my server with Google Cloud services. You may do whatever you choose, although I recommend running Ubuntu.

## Built With

* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) - The web framework used
* [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) - Flask extension for object-relational mapping

## Contributing

Don't submit any pull requests right now, I will decline them. Backend development is limited to me and a partner; however, I chose to complete the project on my own, so all work in this repository is to be done by me.
